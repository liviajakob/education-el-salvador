# Inequality in Access to Tertiary Education – Evidence from El Salvador

The aim of this project is to examine how spatial and socioeconomic factors shape inequalities in access to postsecondary education in the Latin American country El Salvador. The study conducts a logistic regression analysis with multiple predictors using data from the 2015 Salvadoran household survey Encuesta de Hogares de Propósitos Múltiples (EHPM). To include spatial context the number of accessible postsecondary institutions and study programs in different time radii are calculated.
